## üìã Coding Standards

### Dart/Flutter Standards

- Follow the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use proper error handling

### Architecture Guidelines

- Follow Clean Architecture principles
- Use BLoC pattern for state management
- Implement proper separation of concerns
- Add unit tests for business logic
- Use dependency injection with GetIt

### Code Style

```dart
// ‚úÖ Good
class ProductRepository {
  Future<Either<Failure, List<Product>>> getProducts() async {
    // Implementation
  }
}

// ‚ùå Bad
class ProductRepo {
  Future<List<Product>> getProducts() async {
    // Implementation without error handling
  }
}
```

### File Naming

- Use snake_case for file names: `product_repository.dart`
- Use PascalCase for class names: `ProductRepository`
- Use camelCase for variables and functions: `getProducts`

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all business logic
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Use meaningful test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

```dart
test('should return products when API call is successful', () async {
  // Arrange
  when(mockDataSource.getProducts()).thenAnswer(
    (_) async => Right(mockProducts),
  );

  // Act
  final result = await repository.getProducts();

  // Assert
  expect(result, Right(mockProducts));
});
```

### Widget Tests

- Test UI components in isolation
- Mock dependencies
- Test user interactions
- Verify state changes

### Integration Tests

- Test complete user flows
- Test API integrations
- Test navigation flows

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a pull request, please test:

- [ ] App builds successfully on Android
- [ ] App builds successfully on iOS
- [ ] All existing functionality works as expected
- [ ] New features work correctly
- [ ] UI looks good in both light and dark themes
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## üìù Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Use clear and concise descriptions
- Include examples for complex functions

```dart
/// Retrieves a list of products from the remote data source.
/// 
/// Returns a [Future] that completes with either:
/// - A [List] of [Product] objects on success
/// - A [Failure] object on error
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final products = await repository.getProducts();
/// products.fold(
///   (failure) => print('Error: ${failure.message}'),
///   (products) => print('Found ${products.length} products'),
/// );
/// ```
Future<Either<Failure, List<Product>>> getProducts();
```
